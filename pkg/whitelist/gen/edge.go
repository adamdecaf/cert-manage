// We should be able to scrape browser history (e.g. urls) from Microsoft Edge, 
// however that's a bit more complicated as the files are seemingly always locked 
// to other readers. 
// 
// The file is located here: 
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache\WebCacheV01.dat 
// 
// There are utilities available to snapshot the fs path and then read/copy files.
